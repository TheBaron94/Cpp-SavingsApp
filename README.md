# Cpluplus-Program
#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

  This particular project was banking example app, The problem it was solving was to encourage people to save money in savings accounts by showing the amount of money you would have in the account after a set amount of time.

#What did you do particularly well?

  I thought I modularized the program quite well, making future updates if needed easier to do.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

  Had i had the skills to do so at the time, adding Python code as the heavy lifter backend wouldve made the code more efficient and i couldve used c++ to make a true GUI for the program.

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

  The most difficult piece of code for me to write would have been the chart display, It took alot of tinkering to get everything to display properly, Thankfully i found the W3C schools online that have a very user friendly tutorial and guide on c++ for when i forget certain syntaxes or uses for commands.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

  THe modularization skill will be quite useful in the future.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  Again, my heavy modularization of the code will make changes in the future much easier.
